        Temperate is a climate change decision-support tool developed as a part of an Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant with the Department of Energy.

        When I started at Azavea, the company was a year into the two-year SBIR, and had created both a Climate API and the [Climate Lab.](https://climate.azavea.com/) The latter was aimed at making the API more accessible to the project’s target users: climate adaptation planners. 

        Our team conducted interviews with 27 practicioners. At this stage, we were asking open-ended questions in order to better understand the daily duties of our potential users, as well as any frustrations in their current workflows. Insights gleaned from these discussions led us to develop a tool that would do more than just present charts and data.

        Before touching a pencil, I researched tools already in the climate space. This allowed me to get a better sense of what would make Temperate stand apart from the already fairly crowded landscape of tools. I discovered a few key things: 

        - Unsurprisingly, color is dominated by blue and green.
        - Frequently the names of tools are fairly literal.  
        - Marketing efforts in the space tend to focus on data as opposed to user goals.

        My findings from evaluating the existing landscape led me to develop a bright, energetic brand. We went with the name Temperate, inspired by geographically temperate climates. Temperate climates are those without extremes of temperature and precipitation (rain and snow), which made it a perfect analogy for the goal of climate practicioners to reduce the effects of our changing climate.

        Once we had our name, I designed a mascot (internally coined “Tempy”). The mark references the collie dog breed (most notably the border collie), which was bred as a herding dog. The concept was that Temperate acts as an adaptation planner’s best friend, as it herds information, data, and climate data all into one place. Visually, I played with making the mascot reference its name by using a thermometer for the nose.

        To match the brand’s energy, I designed the application to have a friendly and colorful interface. We hoped to make Temperate continue to stand out in this space by giving it a sleek but unintimidating look. The typeface being used throughout the application is Klim Foundry’s National.

        Finally, to assist with quick recognition of frequently dense terminology, I developed custom iconography to represent the various hazards, community systems, and types of policies that could appear in Temperate. While users would be unlikely to recognize these oftentimes complex concepts by the iconography alone, they assist with quicker recognition and add an element of polish.
