        When I started at Azavea, the company was a year into the two-year SBIR, and had created both a Climate API and the [Climate Lab.](https://climate.azavea.com/) The latter was developed to make the API more accessible to the team’s target users: climate adaptation planners. However, the team was hearing that there was not enough guidance in our software, especially since there were so many other tools offering climate data.

        Partnering with ICLEI USA, our team conducted 27 interviews with people in their network. At this stage, we were asking fairly open-ended questions in order to better understand the needs of our potential users. The insights gleaned from these interviews led us down the path of developing a tool that would do more than just present data to our end-users.

        Before touching a pencil, I researched tools already in the climate space. This allowed me to get a better sense of what would make Temperate stand apart from the already fairly crowded landscape. I discovered a few key things: 

        - Unsurprisingly, color is dominated by blue and green.
        - Frequently the names of tools are fairly literal.  
        - Marketing efforts in the space tend to focus on data as opposed to user goals.

        My findings from evaluating the existing landscape led me to develop a bright, energetic brand. We went with the name Temperate, inspired by geographically temperate climates. Temperate climates are those without extremes of temperature and precipitation (rain and snow), which made it a perfect analogy for the goal of climate practicioners to reduce the effects of our changing climate.

        Once we had our name, I designed a mascot (internally coined “Tempy”). The mark is a reference to the collie dog breed. The collie (most notably the border collie) was bred as a herding dog. Like the collie, Temperate is an adaptation planner's best friend, as it herds information, data, and climate data into one place.

        To match the brand’s energy, I designed the application to have a friendly and colorful UI.

        To assist with quick recognition of frequently dense terminology, I developed iconography to represent hazards, community systems, and types of policies.
