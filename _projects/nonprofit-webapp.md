    I worked as the sole UX/UI designer, and had the opportunity to work on many aspects of the final application. As the project is under NDA, I can’t share any visuals or specifics about the work itself but will describe the work completed.

      My company was tasked with improving the usability of their existing MVP. They asked us to first develop Insights gleaned from these discussions led us to develop a tool that would do more than just present charts and data. We embarked on developing a product that would:
      - Actually *guide* practicioners through intepreting climate data.
      - Help users develop a “vulnerability assessment” for their community.
      - Offer suggested actions to take based on a user’s location and particular community needs.

      Before touching a pencil, I researched tools already in the climate space. This allowed me to get a better sense of what would make Temperate stand apart from the already fairly crowded landscape of tools. I discovered several patterns: 

      - Unsurprisingly, color is dominated by blue and green.
      - Frequently the names of tools are fairly literal.  
      - Imagery typically includes environmental symbols, like leaves, sun or water.
      - Marketing efforts in the space tend to focus on data as opposed to user goals.

      This research was crucial in allowing me to establish a benchmark against which to develop and evaluate our product’s brand.

      Once we had our name, I sketched out many directions for the logomark. The name gave me a lot to stew on, but I was looking for a way to have a visual representation of our SaaS product that wouldn’t get lost in a sea of other climate tool logos. Early designs were all over the map – nothing I drew felt quite right for making our tool stand out.

      The application itself retains the bright energy of the brand. As our target users were folks tasked with planning for climate change, but likely without a background in interpreting climate data, I wanted to ensure that the interface was inviting, friendly, and unintimidating.
