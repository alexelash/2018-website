    I worked as the sole UX/UI designer, and had the opportunity to work on many aspects of the final application. I can’t share any visuals or specifics about the work itself, but will describe the process and my role in the project.

      I was tasked with improving the usability of the client’s existing MVP. Though it was already in the hands of target clients, it hadn’t been built with a UX designer guiding the process. As a result, there were many documented usability issues. 

      The client was interested in redesigning core workflows of the application. Additionally, elements were frequently missing state indications and were not designed according to a discernable pattern. This created a confusing user interface, and while it presented an opportunity to refine the typography, interactive elements, and incorporate the client’s brand, I also knew that changes here could enhance navigation for the users.

      Communication would be key to keeping our team aligned with the client’s goals. 

      1. **Discovery session with the product team.** This allowed my team to understand the organizational goals and userbase. 
      1. **Conducted a design audit of the existing features and interface.** This would result in a report to get on the same page with the product team regarding the scope of work and opportunities for improvement. 
      1. **Conduct 11 greenfield user interviews.** There was one particular feature for which the client noted very low engagement. I wanted to ensure that we could better understand how their users conduct their work in order to better understand out how this feature fits into their workflow. Ultimately, this approach revealed that the feature was not being used largely due to a key limitation of the data. Users typically got this information from internal teams as they needed a level of granularity and customization that was not currently possible. Despite the initially disappointing findings, it was a win to both the client and our team to be armed with this information. This feature was ultimately cut from the scope of work and we prioritized enhancing other areas of the application.
      1. **Design revised workflows and conduct small-batch usability tests.** As we were going to suggest considerable changes, we wanted to ensure that our changes made sense both to existing users of the application and potential users. I redesigned workflows as wireframes using Sketch, and hooked them up as prototypes in Marvel. I wrote a testing script and one of my teammembers then conducted tests with several users. The findings led us to make several changes to our thinking before we applied the new designs.
      1. **Overhaul the visual design and UX of the application elements and document changes in a style guide.** One of the biggest issues with the current application was inconsistency in the application of visual design. Elements would appear and disappear depending on availabilty, there were no focus states, color was frequently used and jarring, and color contrast was low. I introduced new UX and UI patterns to elements like data tables, buttons, lists, and navigational elements, bearing in mind a11y. I then documented the changes in a Sketch style guide for the client and future development teams to review changes against.
      1. **Implementation of the designs.** I worked with the development team directly on creating reusable components in a React application, and was also responsible for a11y and final polish of the various elements on the screen.

      This work was completed fairly recently, but the client has so far shared positive feedback from users with our team.
