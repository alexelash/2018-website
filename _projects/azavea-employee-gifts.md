excerpt: Graphic design for my colleagues at Azavea.

    While my primary focus at Azavea is to improve the usability of our products and client projects, I occassionally work with People Operations and our CEO to design swag for employees.

        The CEO’s vision for these shirts was to design something distinctive, and stylish enough that Azaveans would _want_ to represent the company in this way. I applied a topographic map motif to our distinctive, gear-like logo and sourced new, more sustainable t-shirts for the design to be printed on.

        Azavea takes great pride in the robust, well-researched posts on our blog and has long encouraged and rewarded employees for their contributions. I ideated and designed three custom coins that could be awarded on a monthly basis to: first time blog-writers, writers whose blogs brought high traffic to our website, and writers whose blogs have been on a “hot streak”.

        In 2018 and 2019, quite a few Azaveans had additions to their families! As a gift to the growing number of new parents at the company, we designed a fun, Philadelphia-themed onesie.
