intro: I’m Alex Lash, a designer who spends half her days working in color, space and typography, and the other half semantic markup, sweet CSS animations and user-friendly interfaces.

    After graduating from Tyler School of Art, my focus has remained steadfast on designing for the web. The web has and can have a massive effect on people’s lives, and I am inspired and motivated by people who use it for good. My passion is collaborating with teammates and clients to design and develop amazing experiences.

    In my free time, I have volunteered for [ProjectMEOW](http://projectmeow.org/) as a foster and Twitter manager **(#savethemall);** taught and TA’d low-cost classes for women, non-binary and trans men; taught an Interactive class at my alma mater; and helped organize the Philly-based LadyHacks hackathon in 2015 and 2016. 

    When I’m not working, I am usually reading, playing ultimate, cooking something that’s too hard for me, or telling my cat what a good boy he is.
