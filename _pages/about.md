intro: I’m Alex Lash, a designer who spends half her days working in color, space and typography, and the other half semantic markup, sweet CSS animations and user-friendly interfaces.

    Since graduating from Tyler School of Art, my focus has remained steadfast on the web. Every day technology’s impact on people’s lives deepens, and I am inspired and motivated by people who work to improve it.

    I currently work at [Azavea](https://azavea.com) as a User Experience Designer. In my free time, I have taught and TA’d low-cost classes for women; taught an Interactive class at my alma mater; helped organize the Philly-based LadyHacks hackathon in 2015 and 2016; and volunteered for [ProjectMEOW’s](http://projectmeow.org/) social media team. 

    When I’m not working, I am usually drawing, reading, playing ultimate, cooking, or telling my cat what a good boy he is.
