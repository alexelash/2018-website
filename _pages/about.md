    I believe that technology has an outsized impact on people’s daily lives, and am motivated to use it as a tool for good. Since graduating from Tyler School of Art with a Bachelor’s degree in Graphic and Interactive Design, I have had the opportunity to work on many projects with this goal in mind. 

    Currently I work remotely with some incredible folks at [Azavea](https://azavea.com) as a UX and Marketing Designer. In my free time, I have co-organized and co-taught low-cost classes for women of color in tech; taught an Interactive class at my alma mater; helped organize the Philly-based LadyHacks hackathon in 2015 and 2016; and made posters for local non-profit [ProjectMEOW](http://projectmeow.org/). 

    When I’m not working, I am a nomad living on the road, currently based in Europe. In my spare time, I love to draw, play ultimate, cook, and tell my cat what a good boy he is.
