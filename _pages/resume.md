## Designer and Web Developer
### Dyad Communications
Dyad Communications is a boutique agency specializing in the delivery of web experiences for high-end architects and interior designers. My role included a significant amount of direct client interaction throughout the design, development and delivery process as well as the mentoring of Dyad’s more junior developers. 

On a daily basis, I was responsible for programming and maintaining responsive websites using HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, the Sencha Touch framework, PHP and PHP-based content management systems. Beyond my day-to-day duties, I championed and managed Dyad’s migration from SVN to Git version control and was integral in Dyad’s transition from using the ExpressionEngine content management system to WordPress.
